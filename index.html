                <h2>Kobe Bryant's legacy is all over the NBA floor</h2>
                <p>In the 1980s, Michael Jordan launched a stylistic revolution in pro basketball.
                    While not the first great wing player in the sport, Jordan was the first one to absolutely
                    dominate the association. His epic battles versus the Detroit Pistons, Boston Celtics,
                    Los Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz weren't just battles for the Larry O'Brien Trophy --
                    they were battles for the future direction of the sport. MJ won, allowing jump-shooting
                    perimeter players to take over the NBA.

            <h2>Multiple important legacies</h2>
            <p>Jordan and Bryant shared a rare friendship and a number of tactical similarities that will forever
                link the two all-time greats. Their back-to-back careers also reshaped basketball greatness at the
                highest levels. After a generation of young players grew up idolizing MJ, the next crop fell for Bryant.
                </p>
                <p>Both players transcended typical sports dominance by pairing their championships, their MVP awards and
                their scoring titles with aesthetic magnificence. These guys didn't just dominate the best league on
                the planet, they also made that domination look cool as hell. The bold fadeaways, the tongue-hanging,
                the confident showmanship -- all of that was impossible to ignore as the league's up-and-coming stars
                developed their own styles.
